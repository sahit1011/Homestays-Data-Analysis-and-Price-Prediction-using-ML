## Introduction
This project aims to provide insights into the factors affecting the prices of homestays and to predict the prices based on these factors. The analysis includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and model training.
Objective: Build a robust predictive model to estimate the `log_price` of homestay listings based on comprehensive analysis of their characteristics, amenities, and host information.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project includes various attributes of homestays such as location, amenities, ratings, and prices etc. You can find and download the dataset here - https://cerinaco-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/omkar_cerina_co/ETARwr3mqEtAoZFmWmYKnOIBtPhRtBczH9svOQ1gIGqxUg?e=3NwzrD

## Installation
To run this project locally, please ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Necessary Python libraries (listed below)

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Loading**: Load the dataset from the CSV file.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the data, including handling missing values, normalization, and encoding categorical variables.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Feature engineering**: Visualizing the distribution and relationships of various features, Creating new features from existing data.
4. **Model Building**: Construct the deep learning model using appropriate layers and architecture.
5. **Model Training**: Training various machine learning models to predict homestay prices.
6. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating the performance of the models using metrics such as RMSE.

## Results and Conclusions
The results of the analysis and prediction models are detailed in the Jupyter Notebook. The models are evaluated based on their performance, and the best-performing model is identified.
- Further enchancements:
  - 1 . Handling missing values and outliers in more statistical and meaningfull way.
  - 2 . Deriving more meaningfull features. 
  - 3 . Scaling and Encoding numerical and categorial features properly through pipeline.
  - 4 . Model Development using advance models i.e Deep Neural Networks.
